Please make sure to read Rules of Use and Disclaimer (below) before using the server. Introduction BAILnas is an Enterprise-grade NAS. It has the following features: Large, scalable storage: 24 * 10TB redundant disk array, 178 TB usable disk space. 16 * 8TB individually addressed archival hard-drives. Expandable in forms of server cluster. Redundancy protection: NAS data is protected by RAIDZ1 redundant disk array. Current configurations allows up to 3 out of 24 drives to fail without any data loss. Server has redundant power supply and generator-backed UPS to gurantee 24x7x365 operations In case of hard-disk/power failure, the server will continue to function in a degraded state interuptions. Data recovery: All data in the NAS folder is backed-up by snapshots every 6 hours during working hours. In case of mannual errors such as unintended deletes, any folder can be rollded back to any snapshots within the past two weeks. Snapshot roll-backs are available upon request. Please contact system admin . High-speed input/output (i/o): BAILnas is connected to UW network with 10GBps ethernet. Typical sequential data read/write speed from a lab/office PC (1Gbps ethernet) should be approximately 100MB/s. 10GBps bandwidth minimizes i/o conflicts from multiple users. Feel free to process/review data on N drive and T drive. Disclaimer Although the chance of catastrophic server failure is very faint, BAILnas is provided to you with no warranty. UW/BAIL has no responsibility for any data loss. Make MULTIPLE backups to your most critical data!!! Contact For more information or requests email Shaozhen Song .","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#welcome","text":"BAILnas is a Network Attached Storage(NAS) server provided by UW BAIL(Biophotonics And Imaging Lab).
